# vue-repetition

This web app was made during the study week. Repetition of Vue concepts.

It shows my favorite movies. Users can add movies and rate them.

## What we did to create this app

1. Brainstorming, Figma wireframe
2. Prototype in Figma
3. Create Vue project, create GitHub repository
4. Implement prototype in Vue (one component, only HTML/template)
5. Create more components
6. Make them intelligent



### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
