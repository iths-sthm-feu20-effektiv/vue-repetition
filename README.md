# vue-repetition

This web app was made during the study week. Repetition of Vue concepts.

It shows my favorite movies. Users can add movies and rate them.

## What we did to create this app

1. Brainstorming, Figma wireframe
2. Prototype in Figma
3. Create Vue project, create GitHub repository
4. Implement prototype in Vue (one component, only HTML/template)
5. Create more components
6. For each component: make its data dynamic (data properties and computed properties)
7. For each component: move the data to 1) other components or 2) Vuex store, as needed



### To run
```
# install npm packages
npm install

# start local development server
npm run serve

# now open in your web browser
```
